Check it out by [clicking here](https://tichnas.github.io/Sudoku-Solver "clicking here").

This is a simple Sudoku Solver to solve (nearly) all 9 X 9 sudokus.

The algorithm used to solve any given sudoku is Backtracking. This means that in some cases it may take some time to give correct results, or in some rare cases, the page can also become unresponsive. Sorry about that.
